      "How Prepaid Cards directly changed the way people received their Government Benefits.",
    text: "How Prepaid Cards directly changed the way people received their Government Benefits.<br/><br/>In 2013, in order to be more efficient, secure, and save American taxpayers money, the government officially made the move away from paper checks. Before the move to electronic payments was made, hundreds of thousands of government benefit checks were reported as lost or stolen, costing millions of dollars to American taxpayers.<br/><br/>Starting in 2013, the Treasury Department required that all new recipients of federal benefits programs, including Social Security, SSI, Veterans benefits, and government retirement plans, needed either a bank account for direct deposit or they were issued a prepaid, government debit card called Direct Express. Although it was mandated in 2013, the move away from paper checks actually began a couple years earlier, in 2011.<br/><br/>This left recipients with 2 options; direct deposit into a bank account or a prepaid, government issued debit card. If they chose the prepaid debit card option, their only choice was to use Direct Express.<br/><br/>That was then. Today, it’s important to note that those who do receive government benefits via a prepaid debit card have more options available. Companies such as Avid Prepaid offer debit cards that give recipients earlier access to their benefits and more reliable customer service.<br/><br/>You may ask, does Direct Express deposit early? The answer is no, Federal benefits are automatically deposited to the prepaid debit card account on the day of the payment.<br/><br/>The Avid Prepaid card is an option that does provide early access. Avid Prepaid processes the deposits as soon as the Government communicates that it’s sending a payment to the customer. This usually occurs several days before the actual payment date. For example, SSI and VA payments are paid on the first of each month. With the Avid Prepaid card, they’re credited to the account up to six days early every month and all other payments are credited up to two days early.<br/><br/>Many things have changed since the government made the move away from paper checks in 2013. Today, there are more options available for government benefit recipients. Those who choose the Direct Express prepaid debit card option can now make a well-educated decision by researching alternate companies to receive their government benefits from. Like Avid Prepaid, who offers award-winning customer service and perks such as receiving their benefits up to six days early.<br/><br/><small>Avid Prepaid Visa Debit Card is issued by Metropolitan Commercial Bank (Member FDIC) pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc and is not affiliated with Direct Express<sup>®</sup><small>",
